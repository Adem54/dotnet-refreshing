Internally sets up:
A web server (Kestrel),

Logging

Configuration (appsettings.json, environment vars, commandline arguments   etc.)

Dependency injection container
Think of this as the place to register services your app needs:

It is also allow us to send the login output in to the console that we can see in the terminal
‚ÄúIt allows us to send the logging output into the console‚Ä¶‚Äù
 Application messages, warnings, and errors will appear in the terminal or debug output, like:
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]
      Now listening on: https://localhost:5001
info: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Diagnostics[1]
      Request starting HTTP/1.1 GET /
info: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Diagnostics[2]
      Request finished in 23.453ms 200 text/plain
This is all logging output ‚Äî messages produced by the framework and your code using:
ILogger logger;
logger.LogInformation("Processing request...");
logger.LogError("Something went wrong!");

It's used for:
Debugging

Monitoring

Diagnostics

Seeing request flow or application behavior



builder.Services.AddControllers();  // for MVC
builder.Services.AddDbContext<AppDbContext>(); // for EF Core

‚úÖ 2. var app = builder.Build();

This builds the WebApplication object.

It takes everything you set up in the builder (services, config, etc.) and wires it together.

It‚Äôs now ready to configure middleware and define endpoints.


‚úÖ 3. app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello World!");

This sets up a GET endpoint at /.

When a client (browser, Postman, curl) makes a GET request to the root URL, the app returns "Hello World!".

This is part of Minimal API routing.

‚úÖ 4. app.Run();
This starts the Kestrel web server.
It begins listening for HTTP requests.

üß† What‚Äôs unique about this structure?
No Startup.cs file
All configuration is inside Program.cs
Super clean and fast to prototype APIs or microservices


var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
‚úÖ ‚ÄúAfter var app = builder.Build(); ‚Äî the app is ready, and now it's time for configuration of the request pipeline.‚Äù
They‚Äôre referring to how HTTP requests are processed step-by-step inside your application. Let me break it down clearly üëá
üõ£ What is the Request Pipeline in ASP.NET Core?
It‚Äôs a sequence of middleware components that handle every HTTP request that comes in.
Each middleware can:
Inspect the request
Take action (e.g. authenticate, log, route, return a response)
Pass the request to the next step (or stop the chain)

üîÑ Example pipeline in Program.cs


var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

// üëá This is the request pipeline configuration:
app.UseHttpsRedirection();        // Redirect HTTP -> HTTPS
app.UseStaticFiles();             // Serve static files like CSS, JS, images
app.UseRouting();                 // Enable routing
app.UseAuthorization();           // Handle authorization

app.MapControllers();             // Map controller endpoints

app.Run();                        // Start listening for requests


What does pipeline mean in general?
A pipeline is a concept from engineering and computing. It means:
A series of steps, where each step processes input, maybe modifies it, and passes it to the next.
You can think of:
A factory pipeline: raw materials go in ‚Üí multiple machines process it ‚Üí finished product comes out.
A water pipeline: water flows through a series of valves and filters.
A compiler pipeline: source code ‚Üí lexical analysis ‚Üí parsing ‚Üí optimization ‚Üí machine code.

üõ† Why is the term used in ASP.NET Core?
In ASP.NET Core:
The HTTP request is like the ‚Äúmaterial‚Äù going through a series of components (middleware), each doing a job, and passing it on.

These components form a pipeline.
‚¨áÔ∏è Incoming HTTP Request
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.UseHttpsRedirection()
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.UseRouting()
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.UseAuthorization()
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app.MapControllers()
‚¨ÜÔ∏è Outgoing HTTP Response

Each middleware can:
Do something before passing to the next (e.g., check headers)
Or even short-circuit the flow (e.g., return an error immediately)

Each middleware can:

üß© Yes, every HTTP request in ASP.NET Core:-HARIKA BESTPRACTISE....

1-First enters the request pipeline (middleware chain)

2-Flows through middleware one by one ‚Äî in the order you added them

3-Eventually reaches a controller action (or endpoint handler)

4-The response then flows back up through the same pipeline in reverse order

5-Middleware can modify the incoming request, the outgoing response, or even stop the process

üîÑ Realistic flow (simplified):

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

// Middleware pipeline:
app.UseHttpsRedirection();    // Redirect to HTTPS if needed
app.UseRouting();             // Figure out which route is being hit
app.UseAuthorization();       // Is the user allowed?
app.MapControllers();         // Invoke the matching controller/action

app.Run();

üß† What happens under the hood?
1. Incoming request (like: GET /api/games):
‚¨áÔ∏è HTTP Request
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ UseHttpsRedirection() ‚Üí checks HTTPS
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ UseRouting() ‚Üí looks at the URL and figures out which controller method to call
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ UseAuthorization() ‚Üí checks if user has access
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MapControllers() ‚Üí finds the right controller and executes it

2. Controller handles the request:

[HttpGet("api/games")]
public IActionResult GetGames() => Ok(games);

3. Then response flows back:

‚¨ÜÔ∏è HTTP Response
‚Üê MapControllers() returns a result
‚Üê UseAuthorization() lets it pass back
‚Üê UseRouting() does nothing more
‚Üê UseHttpsRedirection() finishes
‚Üí Response sent to the browser

üß™ Bonus: Middleware can do anything

A middleware can:

Log the request

Stop the request and return a custom error

Modify the response body

Check cookies, headers, tokens, etc.


Example:


app.Use(async (context, next) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine("Before controller");

    await next(); // Let the next middleware run

    Console.WriteLine("After controller");
});

You‚Äôll see:

Before controller
[controller executes]
After controller


‚úÖ So yes ‚Äî your summary is 100% correct:
Every request enters the pipeline, passes through middleware before it hits a controller, and the response goes back through the pipeline again before being sent out.
